Assignment Case Study 6: Using Statistics to Identify Spam
Module 10.8 outlines a possible case study for the unit. It is to compare the performance of Naïve
Bayes, CART, and one other classification algorithm of your choosing in classifying messages as spam or ham.

You have the option to choose one (and only one) of the following problems from the back of 
chapter 3: 19, 20, or 21 instead of the case study mentioned at the end of module 10.8.

Whichever case study you choose, write a report on your analysis, including introduction, background, methods, 
results, and conclusions/discussions. We will spend time in the live session or in asynchronous materials on 
cleaning the data; therefore, your write-up need only focus on answering the question of your choice. In other words, 
you do not have to include code that is already in the chapter or in other class materials.

Abstract
In this case study, we explore and examine 9,353 electronic messages that have been classified by 
“SpamAssassin” (http://spamassasin.apache.org) for the purpose of developing and testing spam filters.  
This study is an extension of work previously conducted by the authors of Using Statistics to Identify 
Spam, Nolan and Lang (NTL)[1][2][3].  NTL’s original case study implemented Naïve Bayes and Recursive 
Partitioning and Classification Trees (CART) algorithms to classify messages as spam (unwanted) or 
ham (wanted). The extended analysis will utilize the same dataset and employ alternative classification 
algorithms, namely Random Forest and XG Boost, to improve the performance of the spam filter algorithm.
