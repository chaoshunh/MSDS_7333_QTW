Assignment Case Study 4: Case Studies in Data Science With R
Choose one of the following problems from the back of chapter 2: 7, 10, 11, or 17. 
Write a report on your analysis, including introduction, background, methods, results, 
and conclusions/discussions. Note that the focus of this study is getting the data into 
the correct format. The analysis section is going to be relatively simple from a statistical 
standpoint—graphics, descriptive statistics, etc., to answer the question from the problem 
that you chose.

Abstract
The purpose of this study is to; a) obtain data from website(s) by scraping techniques, 
b) clean, parse and organize the scraped data into a useable format and 
c) perform statistical analysis on the dataset.   The study is an extension of work 
previously conducted by the authors of Modeling Runners’ Times in the Cherry Blossom 
Race (MRCBR), Nolan and Lang (NTL)[1][2]. We will utilize The Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten 
Mile Run and 5K Run-Walk race results for the male runners in the 10-mile races for the years 
1999 thru 2012.  Results were obtained from the race’s official website [3]. Our extended analysis 
will build a model to investigate and compare the male age distribution shifts throughout the 
14-year period between 1999 thru 2012. We are looking at the outcome base statistics such as 
quantile–quantile plots, boxplots, and density curves to make our analysis.
